## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

* Promote repeatable, process-driven development; and to
* Reduce risk by increasing consistency throughout the software development life
  cycle (SDLC)

Modern software development methodologies emphasize the importance of agile behaviors
as opposed to monolithic, linear behaviors commonly seen in the waterfall model.
An agile approach enables a team to quickly react to changes in project requirements
and ever-shifting priorities. Ensuring that developers work in development environments
similar to their peers and as the hosts that their work will ultimately be deployed
to reduces risk by increasing consistency.

[Packer](https://www.packer.io/) is a tool towards that end. It provides a repeatable
mechanism with which to build and provision machine images for use at any stage in
the SDLC.

## How You Can Help
