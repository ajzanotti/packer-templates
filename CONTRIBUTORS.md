## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

* Promote DevOps culture
* Guide users towards current solutions

DevOps emphasizes the importance of agile behaviors over old school, waterfall model-esque ones. Central to this philosophy 
is the idea of reducing inconsistency through the implementation of processes and practices that will provision resources 
in predictable, repeatable states. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a powerful tool to that end and providing 
[Packer](https://www.packer.io/) templates for making custom Vagrant boxes will better enable individuals to improve IT 
within their organizations.

As often as possible developers and operations personnel should be encouraged to use current versions of the software and 
operating systems that they are utilizing. For example, PHP 5.6 over PHP 5.4 and CentOS 7 over CentOS 5. To that end not all 
provisioning scripts or Packer builders are supported for all versions, nor should they be supported.

## How You Can Help

* Add new OS distros and versions
* Add new builders for existing distros
* Bug fixes and user support
